# Google Sign-In Setup Guide

## What's Been Implemented

âœ… **Google Sign-In functionality has been added to your web application:**

1. **Google Sign-In button** added to the authentication page (auth.html)
2. **Supabase OAuth integration** using your provided callback URL
3. **Styled Google button** that matches your brand colors
4. **Automatic redirect** after successful Google authentication

## Next Steps Required by You

### 1. Enable Google OAuth in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication > Settings > Auth Providers**
3. Enable **Google** provider
4. Add your Google OAuth credentials (from the JSON file you mentioned)

### 2. Configure Google Cloud Console
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or use existing one
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `https://kjbelegkbusvtvtcgwhq.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   - `http://localhost:3000` (for local development)

### 3. Update Supabase with Google Credentials
- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Google Cloud Console
- Paste them into your Supabase Google OAuth configuration

## How It Works

1. User clicks "Continue with Google" button
2. Supabase handles the OAuth flow with Google
3. User authenticates with Google
4. Google redirects back to your Supabase callback URL
5. Supabase creates/authenticates the user in your database
6. User is automatically redirected back to your main page

## Files Modified

- `auth.html` - Added Google Sign-In button and functionality
- `index.html` - Ready for future Google Sign-In integration

## Testing the Implementation

1. Open `auth.html` in your browser
2. Click the "Continue with Google" button
3. You should be redirected to Google's OAuth page
4. After completing OAuth setup in Supabase, users will be able to sign in with Google

## Important Notes

- The Google Sign-In works for both **sign up** and **sign in**
- Users who sign up with Google will have their profile automatically created
- The system uses the same Supabase authentication flow as your existing email/password system
- No additional database changes are required

## Next Development Steps

Once you complete the OAuth setup, we can:
1. Add Google Sign-In button to the main page header
2. Improve the user experience after Google authentication
3. Handle edge cases and error scenarios
